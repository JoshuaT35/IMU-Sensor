# IMU-Sensor (XIAO nRF52840 Sense – PlatformIO)

This project contains firmware developed for the **Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense** board using **PlatformIO**.  
The code is tailored for applications involving onboard sensors such as the IMU (LSM6DS3), microphone, and other embedded features supported by the nRF52840 SoC.

## 🚀 Features
- Built for the **XIAO nRF52840 Sense** development board  
- Uses **PlatformIO** as the build environment  
- Supports the onboard **LSM6DS3 IMU** (accelerometer + gyroscope)  
- Structured for easy extension into BLE, sensor fusion, and real-time data processing applications
